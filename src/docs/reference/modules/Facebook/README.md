## Facebook Login

If the site allows to register new users, a local user is created and the Facebook login is linked.  
If a local user with the same email is found, then the external login is linked to that account, after authenticating.

Available settings are:

- CallbackPath: The request path within the application's base path where the user-agent will be returned. The middleware will process this request when it arrives.  
If no value is provided, setup facebook app to use the default path /signin-facebook.

## Users Registration
