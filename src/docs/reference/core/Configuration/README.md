# Configuration

Orchard Core extends ASP.NET Core `IConfiguration` with `IShellConfiguration`.

To learn more about ASP.NET Core `IConfiguration` visit <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration>

## Config Sources

Orchard Core supports a hierarchy of Configuration Sources

* The `Startup` ASP.NET Core Project, e.g. `OrchardCore.Cms.Web.csproj`, `appsettings.json`, or by environment  `appsettings.Development.json`
* Global Tenant Configuration `App_Data/appsettings.json`, or by environment `App_Data/appsettings.Development.json`  
* Individual Tenant Configuration files located under each Tenant Folder in the `App_Data/Sites/{tenant_name}/appsettings.json` folder. **Note:** These are mutable files, and do not support an Environment version
* Environment Variables, or AppSettings as Environment Variables via Azure

The Configuration Sources are loaded in the above order, and settings lower in the hierarchy will override values configured higher up, i.e. an Global Tenant value will always be overridden by an Environment Variable.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the `OrchardCore.Cms.Web.csproj` Startup Project

Orchard Core stores all Configuration data under the `OrchardCore` section in `appsettings.json` files

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
      ... module configurations ...
  }
}
```

Each Orchard Core module has its own configuration section under the `OrchardCore` section

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "OrchardCore.Media": {
      ... individual module configuration ...
    }
  }
}
```

In addition you can specify a `Tenant` setting by using the Tenant Name, in this example the `Default` tenant. The tenant must exist and you need to include a `State` key for it to be recognized by `IShellConfiguration`. The value of the key is not important as the value in the `tenants.json` file will be used. The tenant name is case sensitive.

```
{
  "OrchardCore": {
    "Default": {
      "State": "Placeholder",
      "OrchardCore.Media": {
        ... specific tenant configuration configuration ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `ORCHARD_APP_DATA` Environment Variable

The location of the `App_Data` folder can be configured by setting the `ORCHARD_APP_DATA` environment variable. Paths can be relative to the application path (./App_Data), absolute (/path/from/root), or fully qualified (D:\Path\To\App_Data). If the folder does not exist the application will attempt to create it.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the Global Tenant Configuration `App_Data/appsettings.json`

These settings can also be located in an `App_Data/appsettings.json` folder (not created by default), and any settings specified there will override settings from the `Startup` Project.

### `IShellConfiguration` in the Individual Tenants Folder

These settings are mutable and written during the setup for the Tenant. For this reason reading from Environment Name is not supported.
Additionally these `appsettings.json` files do not need the `OrchardCore` section

```
{
  "OrchardCore.Media": {
    ... specific tenant configuration configuration ...
  }
}
```

### `IShellConfiguration` via Environment Variables

Environment variables are also translated into `IShellConfiguration`, for example

```
OrchardCore__OrchardCore.Media__MaxFileSize

OrchardCore__Default__State
OrchardCore__Default__OrchardCore.Media__MaxFileSize
```

### Order of hierarchy

By default an Orchard Core site will use `CreateDefaultBuilder` in the Startup Project's `Program.cs` which will load `IConfiguration` in the following order

1. Startup project `appsettings.json`
2. Startup project `appsettings.{environment}.json`
3. User Secrets (if environment is __Development__)
4. Environment Variables
5. Command Line Args
6. `IShellConfiguration` will then add these
    1. `App_Data/appsettings.json`
    2. `App_Data/Sites/{tenant_name}/appsettings.json` for the particular tenant

!!! note
    Configurations with the same key that are loaded later take precedence over those which were loaded earlier (last wins).

### Configuration during Deployment

Azure App Settings are supported as Environment Variables on a Windows Environment, and Linux support is coming.

Azure DevOps, or other CI/CD pipelines, are supported, on all platforms, and Json Path Transformations can be used to transform `appsettings.json` files and provide app secrets from pipeline variables, or secret key stores like Azure Key Vault.

If building with the nightly dev builds from the `MyGet` package feed, the CI/CD pipeline will need to use a `NuGet.Config` with the location of the `MyGet` package feed.

```
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="nuget" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"/>
    <add key="myget" value="https://www.myget.org/F/orchardcore-preview/api/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>
</configuration>
```
